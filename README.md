# eCommerce Transactions Analysis

## Overview
This project involves analyzing eCommerce transactions using a dataset consisting of customer profiles, product details, and transaction history. The tasks include:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the dataset and deriving actionable business insights.
2. **Lookalike Model**: Building a recommendation system to find similar customers based on profile and transaction history.
3. **Customer Segmentation**: Clustering customers into meaningful groups using transaction and demographic data.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises three files:
- **Customers.csv**: Customer demographic details.
- **Products.csv**: Product details, including category and price.
